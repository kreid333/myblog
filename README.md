## Installation

There is no installation required to use this application. However, you do need to create a MySQL database called `myblog`, copy the content inside of `seeds.sql`, and run the copied content in your client of choice (I used phpMyAdmin).

## Usage 

The user must first create an account to publish the first post. After this, they can view all posts on the home page, manage posts in the my posts page, and make more accounts if they please.


Instead of running locally, the application can also be ran here:
